# vestiges

_A small Vanilla+ Minecraft mod inspired by quiet adventure, overgrown worlds, and Ghibli-like atmosphere._

---

## what this is

**vestiges** is a small side project fabric mod focused on making Minecraft’s world feel warmer, more alive, and more inviting to wander through.

The main inspiration is that _soft adventure feeling_ you get from Ghibli films. long walks, forgotten places, nature slowly reclaiming human traces. The world isn’t dangerous because it’s ruined; it’s quiet because time passed.

There’s no story to follow and nothing to complete. The mod exists purely to make you want to walk instead of sprint, look around instead of rushing to your destination.

It stays firmly **vanilla+**: no new progression, no RPG systems, no power creep. Just ambience, decoration, and environmental storytelling.

## core idea

> The world used to be lived in.  
> It still feels welcoming, just a little lonely.

You ain't a chosen hero. You just someone passing through a world that’s moved on, where nature and old structures coexist peacefully.

## design goals

- **vanilla+, always**  
  Everything should feel like it could exist in Minecraft already
- **adventure through atmosphere**  
  Encourage walking, exploring, and getting distracted
- **decorative over functional**  
  No loot incentives, no progression hooks
- **soft environmental storytelling**  
  The world suggests history without explaining it
- **minimal worldgen changes**  
  Same terrain, more detail and intention layered on top

If a feature feels loud, gamey, or system-heavy, it probably doesn’t belong here.

## features (current / planned)

### overgrown landscapes

- denser, more varied grass
- bushes, shrubs, and low plants
- fallen leaves, pebbles, twigs
- moss creeping onto stone and structures
- biome-aware placement for natural transitions

### wandering paths

- small dirt / gravel / moss paths
- gently curving, uneven, imperfect
- paths that fade out, split, or end quietly
- not connected to villages or points of interest

They exist to be followed, not to lead anywhere important.

### quiet world decorations

Not real structures, just hints of past use:

- broken fence lines
- low stone walls and fragments
- wooden posts and supports
- campfire circles without fires
- slab or foundation outlines

### subtle human traces

- stairs embedded into hillsides
- slabs that almost form a floor
- doors or windows with no buildings
- details that feel placed, but forgotten

### biome-specific mood

Each biome leans into a slightly different tone:

- **plains** - overgrown fields, old paths through grass
- **forests** — mossy wood piles, fallen logs
- **taiga** — snow-covered fences, abandoned camps
- **swamps** — sunken walls, rotting docks
- **deserts** — wind-buried stone outlines

## what this mod is not

- ❌ no quests
- ❌ no lore books (probably)
- ❌ no dungeons
- ❌ no RPG mechanics
- ❌ no new power systems

This mod doesn’t push the player forward. It invites them to wander.

---

## development status

This is a **solo dev side project**.

There are no strict deadlines or big promises. Things are built slowly, tested by feel, and adjusted when they don’t match the mood. Some ideas might change or get cut entirely.

The goal is cohesion, not feature count.

---

## compatibility

- designed to work alongside other Vanilla+ mods
- no biome replacements or terrain overhauls
- meant to be safe to add or remove (within reason)

---

## why?

Minecraft worlds are big, quiet, and often feel empty in a way that isn’t always intentional.

**vestiges** tries to turn that emptiness into something calmer and more inviting, a place where walking through a forest or across a hill feels like the point, not a delay.

If the mod makes you slow down and take the long way around, it’s doing its job.

Inspired by Studio Ghibli films, Breath of the Wild, Stardew Valley, and similar quiet-adventure worlds.
